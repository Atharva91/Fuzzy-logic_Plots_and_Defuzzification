# Fuzzy-logic_Plots_and_Defuzzification

In real World it is not possible everytime to have an absoulte value that is either 0 or 1.

0 ---> Event not happening

1----> Event is happening

Thats why the concept of fuzzy logic was Introduced so that we can design a system where we can maximize the probability of covering maximum case for more beneficial results.

In this project I have considered 3 standard Trapezoids with different membership function and have plotted the same. We then merged all the 3 membership functions into a single plot to obtain the actual fuzzified output. Once we get the plot we are focused towards the defuzzification of same. The defuzzification methods that We have followed to obtain the crisp values Include:- 

1.) Center of Sum

2.) Weighted Average

3.) First of Maxima

4.) Mean of Maxima

5.) Last of Maxima
